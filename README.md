My notes and code experiments for linear algebra done SVD. The idea is to construct the SVD as soon as possible, then use it for everything else &mdash; from characterizing invertbility to parametrizing the loss surface of linear regression with linearly dependent data columns.

* Code: `/src`


The selection and progression of topics follow the course [Complete linear algebra: theory and implementation in code](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-theory-and-implementation/) by [Prof. Mike X Cohen](http://mikexcohen.com/). Nevertheless, all writing (code and prose), and the errors that come with it, are my own. Check the course out, it's awesome. :=)
